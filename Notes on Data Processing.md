## Processing Pipeline

### Content Extraction

- Extracted news articles from all 5 news websites covering the 2025 calendar year
- Articles saved with metadata including date, title, and URL

### Sentence Tokenization

- Tokenized all articles into individual sentences using spaCy
- Created sentence-level datasets for each news source
- Output files: `*_tokenized.csv` files in `/sentence-datasets/`

### Noun Phrase Extraction

- Used spaCy NLP library to extract nouns and noun phrases from each sentence
- Counted frequency of each noun phrase across all articles
- Output files: `*_noun_phrases.csv` files in `/noun-phrases/` directory

**Filtering Criteria:**

- Noun phrases must appear in at least 20 articles across the corpus
- This filter helped to focus on topics that appear at a reasonable frequency across articles.

### Concept Classification

- Used Llama4-Maverick model to classify noun phrases as:

  - **Concepts:** Abstract or concrete ideas worthy of analysis
  - **Non-concepts:** Generic terms, stop words, or irrelevant phrases
  
- Filtered dataset to retain only classified concepts

### Keyword Classification

- Used Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905 model to further classify concepts into:

  - **Keywords:** Concrete, development-related activities (e.g., infrastructure projects, policy initiatives, economic activities)
  - **Non-keywords:** Abstract concepts, non-developmental activities, or generic terms
  
- Retained only keywords for final analysis

### Manual Review and Final Cleaning

Manual review was conducted to remove remaining noise and determine appropriate cut-off thresholds.

**Specific Cleaning Actions:**

1. Noise Removal:

    The following generic terms were removed as they added no analytical value:

   - "Project"
   - "Programme"
   - "Job"
   - "Design"

2. Term Merging:

    Related terms were consolidated to avoid duplication:

   - "Galamsey", "illegal mining" and "illegal mining activities" were merged as a single keyword

3. **Threshold Determination:** Final frequency cut-off was established based on distribution analysis and relevance
